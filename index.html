    <h1>What is reaction order?</h1>
    <p>In chemical kinetics, reaction order describes how the concentration of reactants affects the rate of a chemical reaction.</p>

    <p>. Zeroth Order: In a zeroth-order reaction, the reaction rate is constant and independent of the concentration of the reactant. This means that the reaction continues at the same speed no matter how much reactant is present. You can think of this as a situation where the reaction is controlled by something other than the reactant, like a limiting factor (e.g., a catalyst). In terms of data, this might seem like an artifact, as the concentration does not change the reaction speed.</p>1

2. First Order: A first-order reaction depends on the concentration of one reactant. As the reactant breaks down or changes, the reaction rate slows down proportionally. For example, if you have a single molecule breaking apart or transforming, the more molecules there are, the faster the reaction happens. If you double the concentration, the rate also doubles.

3. Second Order: In a second-order reaction, the rate depends on the concentration of two reactants or the square of one reactant. This is like two particles needing to collide to react. So, as you increase the concentration of either reactant, the likelihood of collisions increases, making the reaction happen faster.
